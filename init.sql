Thanks for coming all today to support OpenSource Bitcoin. I'd like to talk about what I was on this summer. I worked on Tapirt and a privacy toolkit for developers. So I'm based in Zurich. I'm U.S. Board, I'm a Japanese parent and I spend a good part of my life in Switzerland. I first learned about Bitcoin when my mom got access hacked in 2014. Back then, none of my friends in Tokyo could tell me what Bitcoin was that has changed quite a bit since then, but come a long way. I learned Bitcoin by building a lot of mini projects to learn about what transactions are our testnet, what kind of P2B messages exist and how the protocol works, and like basic payment channels. I learned all this stuff by building these little small projects. And these projects eventually grew into a full Bitcoin developer course. And that's what I teach today at 21 lecturers. I'm a coach writer with UNESCO and Christian Decker. These are a long time core contributors. And for those who can't come, I have an online class at teachbecoin.io. Why teach part of the curriculum over the fourth week period online? The people who come to this course are developers from exchanges, Bitcoin ATMs, Bitcoin Wall manufacturers, and it's pretty cool because these guys work with Bitcoin every day, but they mostly interact with Bitcoin via the RPC interface. And this has actually spend a couple of days building on top of the protocol directly, is pretty cool. I'm very fond of it. So I enjoy that a lot. I'm also a contributor to Libcoin. Libcoin is a C++ Bitcoin library, and it provides a lot of the low-level libraries and modules for somebody to get smart about the Bitcoin protocol. If we're Bitcoin, I worked at a couple of startups. I'm a co-founder of a full-level take simulation company. I've also worked in data science. I started on my career at NASA at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena. And I think there's some parallels and experts that had there with Bitcoin, namely, the design process is extremely rigorous. You have a lot of mission-critical components. And I see that happening in Bitcoin as well, where you have a lot of people reviewing every little change, except that happens online and not in a conference room. Okay, so why is Bitcoin important to me? Bitcoin is important to me because I believe it became apparent to me that the ports of Bitcoin really is in its role as an alternative, right? Not more, not less. And it can only be an alternative money if a remains censorship resistant as a technology as an open-source project. It cannot work without privacy. If the actors in the system are not anonymous, they can be attacked. So this is something that I believe is extremely important to the success of the Bitcoin project in the long term and something that I really wanted to work on. And fortunately, Bitcoin is just sort of private today. It's not very private, right? Like the chain analysis tools, as you probably all know, have become very sophisticated, they're very strong here, risks to be able to determine Bitcoin ownership, Bitcoin Tain. And together with KYC, they're kind of risks by circuiting the system into a white and black market part. So that's not good. We do have some kind of measures like coin-joint, coin-joint is useful, but it's relative expensive. And anonymity said it's not guaranteed. You don't really know who you're mixing with, obviously. There is some more advanced privacy tech. A lot that's happening in cryptography. But a lot that may be in research phase is very complex. So we'll take a lot of time before it makes itself a waste. We do have layering protocols like lightning that have been pretty successful than having a lot of traction. But the thing with layering protocols is that they rely on contracting protocols, which once dropped on chain can be correlated and are visible to the public. So that's something that we can improve. So this is where Schmoren Tapper would make a big difference in terms of privacy. These are proposals, two proposals, together with Tapper script three proposals, which are written by Peter Willey with the help of a lot of other contributors. And in terms of privacy, they bring two important things. Firstly, indistinguishable contracts. That means we have outputs which are a lock by different spending conditions, but to the observer on chain, they look like regular puppies. And therefore indistinguishable. Tapper introduced the ability to hide complex script structures into a puppy. So in that sense, they are hidden from the observer on chain. And these are both huge privacy wins for Bitcoin. But it is Bitcoin after all. So changes require consensus. So people users will need to use them. Developers will need to support the upgrade. And so requires some kind of socialization in the community for Schmoren Tapper to actually be activated. And I think what I wanted to work on this summer is to provide an accessible way for a developer to do that. And today we don't have easy to use toolkits for a developer to immediately build on top of Schmoren Tapper. So that's what I did. So this is my project. It's a developer toolkit built on top of Bitcoin Core. Specifically, it's a Tapper Grange written by Peter Willey. The Tapper consensus is already implemented. But there is only very thin shnore and Tapper class layer in the original branch. So what I've done is expanded with modules like Music, Adaptorsix, Discrete Law Contracts, and Tapper classes, which allow the user to actually experience how to give the user the tools to build very private protocols without having to read the paper, build their own implementation, from scratch, from just Tapper and Shnore. So to demonstrate what a developer can do with the library, I like to show some examples. So the first examples are our indistinguishable contracts. These are basically primitives which are a power-bushnore. The first one is Music. So today, a multi-sick spend or an output, that's a very observable on-chain because they're multiple puppies that are visible. Music allows us to aggregate these puppies so that on-chain, a single puppy is only visible. Singles were signing when this puppy is spent. The signatures from the multiple parties can be aggregated, and the only single signature is dropped to chain. So from the on-chain observer, point of view, this looks like a regular single spend transaction. So the anonymity set becomes much larger, even though it's actually a multi-sick-nature contract. Another useful tool for privacy or atomic swaps. So atomic swaps are when two users swap coins without anybody else knowing. They're by obscuring the coin ownership. If we want to do that today, however, it requires a hash-based system, or a hash-bed output, which means that a transaction requires a secret pre-image to be spent, and that pre-image then is used in the second transaction. Where the funds are being exchanged. And because the pre-image needs to be dropped on-chain in the witness, these two transactions can be correlated by any on-chain observer. So that's not good for privacy, obviously. With Schnor and adapter signatures, we can do much better. So adapter signatures always are forms, signature pairs with regular signatures, and the correlating secret is hidden within. So you can see in the first transaction where A is in to B, be signature together with the adapter signature releases a secret off-chain, and the second user can then use that secret to reconstruct the signature, here she needs, to conduct the second transaction, thereby completing the swap. So we swapped coin owners, and we've done it in a way where these two transactions are completely uncorrelated on-chain. So that's great from the privacy point of view. Schnor also enables new features, new contracting features, which were impossible before. So in this case, we want to have different contracts or puppies. Execute only if an off-chain Oracle creates the corresponding signature. So say Oracle signs B that A. That signature allows signature one to be created, which spends pub key one, but not for pub key two, and not for pub key three. If the Oracle signs for event B, the second pub key can execute. If Oracle signs for C, the third. So this allows us to bring trusted off-chain information onto on-chain script execution. Again, in a way which is observable by the on-chain observer, they just look like regular single-spend transactions. So this can part of the toolkit is around taproot. Taproot means we can hide Bitcoin script in a very nice way. So let's first consider how Bitcoin scripts work today. This is, I think, recognized in the HLC. HLCs are used to forward payments and lightning, and an HLC needs to encapsulate quite a bit of, you know, spending logic. The first one is the success case. So the forwarding payment has been successfully delivered. This is the part of the execution of the script that is actually executed, highlighted in orange. The forwarding attempt can also fail. You can time out and need to be reversed. And that's the case where this part of the script is being executed. And finally, the state of the channel can be updated where the HLCs must be revoked, and that executes, again, another part of the script. So every time these scripts are actually dropped on chain, the entire contract is revealed revealing quite a bit of information, which can be correlated to de-anonymize users of the lightning network. So we can do better. With a taproot toolkit, the user now doesn't need to worry about Bitcoin script. It simplifies things quite a bit. The user only needs to worry about the different spending conditions. The first one being success, the pub key and a hash, the second one being a timeout, pub key and a time. And the third one being revocation, where we just need a revocation key. The different spending paths are only revealed if that scenario occurs. So you can see in the timeout scenario, it's this branch, in the revocation scenario, it's this branch, and only a proof of that branch needs to be broadcasted on chain. And everything else remains secret and private. So the goal here is to provide the developer with a basic highly-relevel language. We can introduce tap script descriptors, so that they even have to worry about Bitcoin script, and can actually just implement the kind of contracting logic that they want together with the utilities like the tree solver, which generate the tree structure for more complex taproot outputs. So you can see the privacy design space has really been open up quite a bit with which North and Taperot, and that's really a huge win. However, this stuff takes time. I think if there's something that we learn with segway is that the socialization of a new soft fork is really something that needs engagement of the community. And in the meantime, Taperot itself takes time before it's actually integrated into Bitcoin core fully. In the meantime, in this period of time, developers need tools, which allow them to easily and assessably start using the power of story in Taperot to build protocols and applications, prototypes, and Taperot's uptake has been a great supporter of this project this summer. We will be using this library to deliver two workshops and coming weeks where we teach taproot and Shnor to the developers in the Bitcoin industry. For myself, I really look forward to being part of this process to bring Taperot and Shnor to activation. One of the things that I really want to look on in contribute to as well is implementing the technology into other parts of Bitcoin core like the world which will eventually destroy as a reference client implementation for the wider community."}	{"title":"James Chiang, Schnorr and Taproot - Chaincode  Demo Day","transcript_by":"adamjonas via TBTBTC v1.0.0\\n","categories":"None","tags":"None","speakers":"None","date":null,"media":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAJT8TPfpcs","body":" Hello everyone, my name is James.

M2 Outlandish The 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros perform around 20 to 30% faster than their M1-drive counterparts, at least according to Apple's graphs and can be configured with up to 96 gigabytes of RAM if you're Elon Musk. There's also M2 and M2 Pro equipped Mac Minis so I can get my mom a discounted M1 version soon. But if you watched Apple's 18-minute video keenly looking for any sign of the company's mixed reality headset, keep waiting. It'll probably still show up in June, although will be waiting longer for Apple's lighter AR glasses, which have been delayed in favor of making a cheaper headset for the Quest 2 crowd. But that wasn't actually everything that Apple officially announced this week. There's a new full-size HomePod 2 for $2.99 after Apple pulled the old one because no-am bought it. It's apparently better even though it has less physical speakers inside it, but that might be to make room for unknown sensors. Like the secret temperature and humidity sensor that Apple just activated in the HomePod Mini. People bought it without even knowing it was in there. What else is in there?

What do you mean you don't have more than you don't even have an iPad? You don't need another device to set up the Apple TV. So this was confusing. Thankfully, there is a workaround involving signing out from the Apple TV's settings, but Apple would really prefer you to have an iOS device on hand, because otherwise how is it going to collect your user data without your consent? That's right, France just find Apple a whole $8.5 million A.K.A. The amount of cash it gives its kids to spend at the corner store. For that whole debacle from a few months ago, where it was found that Apple's personalized ads toggle in iOS did absolutely nothing in most of Apple's own apps. Because what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone, it's just you have to understand that Apple servers are part of your iPad...\\n\\n##  Getty Images sues Stability AI\\n\\n phone. And in non-appal news, Gettie Images has sued Stability AI, the maker of popular AI Art tool-stable diffusion in the second major lawsuit over what the heck we're going to do about the copyright thing now that art can be absorbed mixed around and reconstituted like a Freaks Star Trek Transporter accident. Gettie Images says Stability AI copied and processed millions of images protected by copyright without a license, although Gettie CEO Craig Peter said they're not seeking monetary damages, they just want to establish a precedent for this kind of thing. And yeah, sure, if people pay for licenses as part of that as a matter of conscience, then fine. And to be clear, we do need that precedent and education and transparency regarding this AI stuff because people are freaking out and thinking Adobe is definitely training AI with your Photoshop files, which the company has denied. But was that press released written by chatGPT? How can you know? I don't know, maybe we can burn through a bunch of these lawsuits really quick. We should just use that AI lawyer bot.

M2 Outlandish The 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros perform around 20 to 30% faster than their M1-drive counterparts, at least according to Apple's graphs and can be configured with up to 96 gigabytes of RAM if you're Elon Musk. There's also M2 and M2 Pro equipped Mac Minis so I can get my mom a discounted M1 version soon. But if you watched Apple's 18-minute video keenly looking for any sign of the company's mixed reality headset, keep waiting. It'll probably still show up in June, although will be waiting longer for Apple's lighter AR glasses, which have been delayed in favor of making a cheaper headset for the Quest 2 crowd. But that wasn't actually everything that Apple officially announced this week. There's a new full-size HomePod 2 for $2.99 after Apple pulled the old one because no-am bought it. It's apparently better even though it has less physical speakers inside it, but that might be to make room for unknown sensors. Like the secret temperature and humidity sensor that Apple just activated in the HomePod Mini. People bought it without even knowing it was in there. What else is in there?

I'm here with merch hi there. Today we're gonna jump into the temple and That's a pun if you didn't get it. Welcome to Jankoid decoded the temple The temple an area you are more than familiar with yeah a Nampool whispery in the call. Yeah, let's maybe start with what's the relationship between the Mimpool and fees? We often talk about the Mimpool, but there is no such thing as a global Mimpool Every full-known has its own Mimpool and the Mimpool is basically just the queue of transactions waiting to get Confred where Confred means included in a block. So by default Block template builders will just sort the waiting transactions by the highest effective fee rate Then pick from the top the juicier transaction the quicker gets confirmed now Especially in the last few months we've seen that there was a very large queues because we had a huge run up in the price I haven't checked but I think it's now about a hundred and twenty days that We haven't cleared the Mimpool maybe a hundred and ten and since 15th of December So Mimpools are limited and By default they are limited to 300 megabytes of De-serialized data So that includes all day overhead structure the previous U-tix O's maybe even the whole transaction that created U-tix O's and so forth So roughly at about 80 blocks worth of data the default of 300 megabyte gets exceeded and at that point a full node will automatically start Perching the lowest fee rate transactions data stop them and tell all their neighboring peers Hey, don't send me anything under this period. They they start raising up their min fee rate So the problem that gets introduced here is if a parent transaction is no longer in the Mimpool You cannot bump it because if you try to do a CPP and the pair doesn't there the child is gonna be invalid CFF just for the initiated child place for parent Some things that are being done in the context of that is that people are working on Package relay where you can send more than one transaction to appear as a package that they evaluate as a whole together Instead of looking at the parent and saying okay you're out and this child doesn't have a parent Okay, you're out to And maybe you can just talk a little bit more about the mechanics of how CPS fee actually works to get into a block You bid on block space transactions get serialized in an apartment Where inputs are fair we big outputs are smaller there's a little bit of a transaction header that includes like how many inputs there output there and Lock time inversion So we already found out that when miners build blocks days Sort transactions by the highest period so they first considered the transactions that paid the most set-touchies Per byte of serialized data. So what's the mechanic where the mechanics of CPS fee when you try to Get a transaction through sometimes they have a Firit that is to low for it to be considered quickly and you can reprioritize your transaction by Increasing its effective Firit now you cannot edit a transaction after you submitted it to the network because the Transaction itself is immutable But what you can do is you can spend one of their outputs of the transactions with a Another child transaction that has a very high fee and Now the child transaction can only be valid by the parent getting included in the block So miners will look at transaction packages actually they sort the weight list by the M sister fee rate of transactions not just by transactions in the singular So when you have a child that is super juicy it basically pays for the parent to get included at low as well So literally tell pace for parent got every parents dream to have their children pay for You said that when miners evaluate these Fee rates is that built in the Bitcoin core are they writing custom software for that Bitcoin core has a get black template corn which allows you to exactly do that just generate a black template But I believe that most miners are probably running custom code because for example They accept out of band payments to reprioritize transactions or they run their own wallet service on this side and always prioritize their own transactions or They might have some sort of other solver that optimizes block template building further So I think that I haven't looked at this in detail, but I think that at least they're not running default values because By default blocks created by Bitcoin core would leave a little space. I think about six kilo bytes and blocks are full if you look at them. So they must have at least treated a little bit and we're not when we say miners We're talking about pools. Yes, right so most miners as in the People running a six or whatever They just join our pool who does the coordination of the work and They basically the pool operator picks the block template that is being worked on and the miner just gets a separate workspace that they iterate over in order to try to fund the This problem sounds hard. Why is it hard to estimate periods? So block discovery is a random process think of like Decay of radio active isotopes What we do there is we can give you a half time It usually takes around this much of time for half of the atoms to Disappade But we can't tell you if we look at a single atom when it's actually gonna Disappade it might be immediately it might be at the half time it might take decades Right with blocks that's the same thing there in average coming in at I think about 9.7 minutes But when the next block is gonna be found is up to this random press on process Actually it is such that since there is no memory to the process It's every draw just has a chance to succeed at every point in time The next block is about 10 minutes away in the average. Yeah, it's really intuitive to think about that Right if even if you're 18 minutes into not finding a block the next block will be found in 10 minutes Yes, exactly you don't know when the next block is gonna be found So you don't know what transactions you will be competing against you might be competing against the transactions that I Translate in the man pool plus the transactions that get added in the next one minute You might be competing against the transactions in the man pool plus 10 minutes or plus 60 minutes Because about once a day There's a block that takes 60 minutes really you have this one shot to pick exactly the right view To slide in at the bottom of the block that you want to be in because if you don't slide in at the bottom of the block You're overpay and if you underestimate you're not gonna get confirmed in the time that you were aiming to be confident And so how do exchanges usually do this are they overpaying? Are they just estimating the the upper end? Maybe like who's paying those fees? Right, there's different scenarios some exchanges have different tiers like low-time preference and high-time preference or whatever and they treat those differently But generally most exchanges by now batch their withdrawals Which gives them a way to leverage their scale So if you're sending to 20 people every minute Making one transaction out of that is a lot cheaper than making 20 separate payments It's also much easier to manage your due-to-to-pull that way and And Then they just tend to very conservatively estimate their fees just Be in the next two blocks and maybe rather overpay slightly because it's so much less work To deal with all the customer compliance over step-transactions than to to pay like sure we're overpaying by 30% to be in the next block But it's not them that's overpaying Is they usually that gives passed on the customer? There's different models. I think in most actually the exchange pays But they take a flat fee for a withdraw or really yeah, so like it's time for a very long time for example I'd like I think a 90 cent 90 Euro cent flat restraw fee But then they'd bet every few minutes only you said that the member who hasn't really been empty for almost four months Yeah, that's correct. Is the ever gonna empty again as we go to the moon does the what happens to the man pool? Yeah, that's a great question. I think we'll eventually see a man pool empty again But there should probably be a long tail end to it emptying Because now in this for months a lot of the exchanges that usually would do consolidations to keep their you take so pool sized Manageable they haven't been able to get any of those through so when the fee rates go down now I think that we'll see more people put in their consolidation transactions had like three to five such as per bite And that I think we might not see an empty man pool for multiple months So even if the top fee rates get a lot more relaxed now Generally the competition to be in blocks seems to correlate with volatility and especially price rises when when the market Heats up and and people are more excited to trade There's more transaction volume on the network and Now we've seen in the past four weeks or so the price has been going more sideways There might have been even a small dips here and there and the top fee rates have come down On the on the weekends that's dropped first to seven set of sheet per bite then six and now last weekend Six was clear completely I don't think that getting a one set of super by transaction a true will be possible at any time soon But it'll be very possible to wait to the weekend to get a ten set of super by transactions Maybe from like a more met-of-you know the miners like this don't they like having high fees because One is revenue for them but also As we sort of zoom out we think about the decreasing block reward over time Don't we have to have a high fee environment in order for this this is the work under one hand You have to also consider that the exchange rate 10x in the last year So the same fee rates represent a 10x purchasing value in cost for Getting a sense to the same service a transaction into a block so while the fee rates are similar The cost of getting a transaction through has actually increased there miners do love it because I think he rates make about 17% or so of the block reward right now So I'm not sure yeah, that's that's a nice little tip right But there's definitely a concern that when we continue to reduce the blocks subsidy in the every four year having rewards schedule that eventually the system will have to subside just transaction fees and if the transaction fees are to low it will Basically not be Economic for miners to provide security to the bit-ten system so there's a good argument for not Increasing the block space To our degree where it's always gonna be empty if you want to do that you essentially have to Also switch to an endless block subsidy otherwise there is no economic incentive for miners to continue mining if there's Not enough fees unless unless your minimum fee rate at some point becomes So valuable that even at minimum fee rate any transactions are Some sort of sufficient revenue for miners to continue their business Maybe we can sort of circle back to what happens when transactions are elected from the mumpul and to talk about like what problems Like it introduced especially for fee bumping and and lightning channel closing right When a mumpul fills up as we said earlier the node will start dropping the lowest fee rate transactions And especially for people or services that use Unconfirmed inputs that can be a problem at times because you cannot Spend an input that is unknown to other nodes Right, so if all other nodes on a network have dropped a transaction Your polar option that spends the output from that drop transaction will not be able to relay on in that work So you Cannot only not spend your hands, but you can also not Repair or ties the prior transaction One thing that this solves basically is RBF because you can just rewrite a replaceable transaction and submit a transaction with a higher fee rate All right, so we went over CPSP can we go over our BS? Sure So dip one 25 introduces rules by which you are allowed to replace transactions You have to explicitly signal data transaction is replaceable and In that case before a transaction is confirmed the sender may issue an updated version of the transaction Which can completely change the outputs the only restriction is that it has to use one of the same inputs Otherwise it wouldn't be a replacement And wouldn't be so it has to be a conflicting transaction essentially and Additionally, it has to pay enough fees to replace the prior transaction and all the transactions that changed off of them In the mimpul so if you had like three transactions you have to pay more fees and the replacement than those three transactions together All right, so blast double spending It's over site. I do not like to term double spending in that context So the problem with that is a successful double spend means that Either you actually got two transactions that were in conflict confirmed Which could basically only happen if you have two competing blocks where one Block had a prior version and a second block had a netty and then the second block eventually becomes part of the best chain Or when you at least convince somebody that they had been paid But then actually managed to spend the funds somewhere else But here in this case are the f transactions are Explicitly labeling themselves as replaceable basically they're running around with a red lettered sign on front of their chest Do not trust me, right and most wallets are for just doesn't show your rb f transactions until they are confirmed Once confirmed in the blockchain they're exactly the same and same reliability as any other transaction But while tuing they are explicitly saying look, I could be replaced do not consider yourself paid So calling this a double spend is really just saying that well Somebody made extremely unreasonable assumptions about the reliability of a transaction that explicitly warned them that It's not reliable so I like conflicting transactions more in this context and maybe why do we need two ways to bump fees? Why do we need RBF and CPFB right so they have slightly different traders CPFP allows any recipient of a transaction to bump it Right that could be a recipient in the sense that the person that got paid or The sender if there was a change I'd put on the transaction it also doesn't change the tx ID because you're just training Advait transactions on it and it it takes more blocks this right because you now have to send a second transaction in order to Increase the effective fee rate of the first so more blocks this Easier to keep track off and more flexibility as in there's more parties than can interact with it RBF on the other hand allows you to completely replace the transaction Which means that it is more flexible But you potentially have to pay more fee use especially if somebody else changed off of your transaction already It changes the tx ID and a lot of wallets and services have been tracking payments by the tx ID Rather than looking at like what address got paid what the amount was or Whatever as in like treating the current addresses as in voices as they should be used they built a whole system around tx IDs so our BF transactions that They changed the inputs are outputs right otherwise they couldn't change the fees and that means that they have a new tx ID And it it is not trivial to keep proper track of that and to update your UX and UI to make that Easily accessible to your users right then also only the sender can run per transaction Think that because they have to reissue the updated variant of the transaction Given that it is a little more difficult to interact with our BF transactions a lot of services Only see them once they're confirmed once they're reliable so if you're trying to get a service To give you something very quickly You might want to choose to not do an RBS transaction the first place though that they can Reasonably assume oh this has a high enough fee read and we know the user We can trust them that they're sending us these three dollars actually and give them Existed it so I don't know what I thought it okay So we asked the question like what problems do does an employee eviction Cause for fee bumping and and also maybe the lightning Channel closing use case we talked a bit generically about how parent transactions being gone Staps you from being able to spend those unconfermed output But does this especially a problem in the context of lightning because when you close a lightning channel It's either the collaborative case where you have no problem because you can really go see it the closing transaction with your partner But where you really needed you're trying to unilatory close because your partner has Channel partner hasn't shown up in all then if you you have to fall back to the transaction that you had negotiated Sometime in the past when you last updated the commitment transaction So let's say that was in a low fee read time and now the fee read suffix loaded and you can't actually even Broadcast the commitment transaction to the network because it's too low fee read Now the problem is the parted that is closing the lightning channel under the LN penalty update mechanism their funds are actually locked with a csv So they can't do cp because The output is only spendable after the transaction is confirmed for multiple blocks So you can't obtain a transaction to a output that is not spendable while it's still in the income Especially for enlightening this introduces the volatility in the the block space martin introduces a headache because You can literally come into the situation where you can close your lightning channel due to the fee read So one approach I've heard about is to introduce anchor outputs Which are depending on the proposal either spendable by either side or spendable on certain conditions But they immediately spendable so they can be cp of peat or Another idea is to have package relay right because if the Channel closing transaction has a low fee read and you can then relay it together with a second transaction That'll work except if you're in the naturally closing because the csv issue still Pretends to that but either way if you get package relay you would be able to do away with the the estimate and Commitment transactions altogether because we talked about how fee estimation is hard for regular transactions The estimation for a commitment transactions is even much harder because you have no clue when you will want to use the transaction Yeah, that depends if they seem Very scary right you you have absolutely no clue what the fee rates will be like when when you actually try to use it So having Packetry lay would in combination with anchor outputs would allow you to always have a zero fee on the commitment transaction And then basically always bring your own fee when you broadcast it in the Cp P P Touch Transaction got it okay, so we sort of talked about specific but maybe we can zoom out and you know What are some ways that we could be using our box based more efficiently? What are some things that make us optimistic about the future? We still have Only about I think 40% or so Segwood inputs now about 50% percent of all transactions use Segwood inputs, but the majority of inputs is still non Segwood Once more people start using Segwood or even tap root once tap root comes out The input sizes will be smaller. So naturally there will be more space for more transactions So recently a major service wall service provider and How I'm first of April nonetheless that they would be switching to native Segwood addresses and they they had been a long holdout So blockchain.com has Probably around 33% of all transactions creations among their use of this yeah, I mean that dependency is We're shaking our heads simultaneously Great Segwood activated on 24th of August in 2017 Right, that's three and a half years ago and until recently I think they they weren't even able to send to native Segwood addresses and now they announced that not only They'll actually default native Segwood addresses altogether I think they claimed this month, but I'm hoping that they'll come true with that because we have a huge backlock of all use outputs that they created over the years It has been one of the most popular bit carnwallas for yeah almost a decade And it will take forever for all of these non Segwood outputs to eventually get spent But the observation is that most Inputs are Consuming just very young outputs so funds that got moved are much more likely to move again soon so Seeing that Chanda.com will hopefully switch to native Segwood output soon I would assume that even while the U.T.s O set will have a lot of non Segwood outputs living there for a very long time The transactions that get built very well much quicker become Segwood transactions to a high degree If 33% of all transactions let's say 80% of them become Segwood inputs and Literally more than half their input sides that would be I want to say like 15% of the current blocks based demand Going away overnight. Yeah, yeah That's right. I think they calculate more more certainly, but other other holdouts Bit max recently switched to native Segwood I think for deposits there's still Quite a few services that use rap Segwood rather than native Segwood which already gets most of the efficiency but clearly not all it was actually expecting that the high fee rates might get more people moving I think that the tap root roll out might get a huge Block space efficiency gain because Tap root introduces a bunch of new features that are only available fruit Tap root and tap root outputs and inputs are about the size of pay-to-avitness public key hash in total So smaller than a lot of the multi-state constructions these days even in native Segwood and Definitely smaller than everything non Segwood so any any wallet that switched to tap root roll Bring down the blocks based use a lot quickly. Yeah, the multi-state savings are pretty significant yeah And local little bring in a new era of Multi-state being more standard. I think that'd be that's the system work setting thing it'll take quite some time because to do the Public key aggregation that will bring the biggest efficiency gain people will actually have to implement new Segwood or another aggregation algorithm and until that gets into regular wallets Will be a while. I think maybe the first it gets into libraries and and Especially for services with multi Segwood wallets There would be a huge efficiency gain there and they they should have Great incentives to roll it out very quickly Great Thanks for listening to another episode of chain code decoded and we're gonna keep it rolling we'll have another one next week Yeah, let's talk about maybe how the blockchain works go back to basics in a time"}	{"title":"dggb","transcript_by":"masterchief164 via TBTBTC v1.0.0\\n","categories":"['hello', 'hi']","tags":"['tag1', 'tag2']","speakers":"['speaker1', 'speaker2']","date":"2023-01-30","media":"test/testAssets/audio.mp3","body":" Welcome to the Jankoid podcast. I'm here with merch hi there. Today we're gonna jump into the temple and That's a pun if you didn't get it. Welcome to Jankoid decoded the temple The temple an area you are more than familiar with yeah a Nampool whispery in the call. Yeah, let's maybe start with what's the relationship between the Mimpool and fees? We often talk about the Mimpool, but there is no such thing as a global Mimpool Every full-known has its own Mimpool and the Mimpool is basically just the queue of transactions waiting to get Confred where Confred means included in a block. So by default Block template builders will just sort the waiting transactions by the highest effective fee rate Then pick from the top the juicier transaction the quicker gets confirmed now Especially in the last few months we've seen that there was a very large queues because we had a huge run up in the price I haven't checked but I think it's now about a hundred and twenty days that We haven't cleared the Mimpool maybe a hundred and ten and since 15th of December So Mimpools are limited and By default they are limited to 300 megabytes of De-serialized data So that includes all day overhead structure the previous U-tix O's maybe even the whole transaction that created U-tix O's and so forth So roughly at about 80 blocks worth of data the default of 300 megabyte gets exceeded and at that point a full node will automatically start Perching the lowest fee rate transactions data stop them and tell all their neighboring peers Hey, don't send me anything under this period. They they start raising up their min fee rate So the problem that gets introduced here is if a parent transaction is no longer in the Mimpool You cannot bump it because if you try to do a CPP and the pair doesn't there the child is gonna be invalid CFF just for the initiated child place for parent Some things that are being done in the context of that is that people are working on Package relay where you can send more than one transaction to appear as a package that they evaluate as a whole together Instead of looking at the parent and saying okay you're out and this child doesn't have a parent Okay, you're out to And maybe you can just talk a little bit more about the mechanics of how CPS fee actually works to get into a block You bid on block space transactions get serialized in an apartment Where inputs are fair we big outputs are smaller there's a little bit of a transaction header that includes like how many inputs there output there and Lock time inversion So we already found out that when miners build blocks days Sort transactions by the highest period so they first considered the transactions that paid the most set-touchies Per byte of serialized data. So what's the mechanic where the mechanics of CPS fee when you try to Get a transaction through sometimes they have a Firit that is to low for it to be considered quickly and you can reprioritize your transaction by Increasing its effective Firit now you cannot edit a transaction after you submitted it to the network because the Transaction itself is immutable But what you can do is you can spend one of their outputs of the transactions with a Another child transaction that has a very high fee and Now the child transaction can only be valid by the parent getting included in the block So miners will look at transaction packages actually they sort the weight list by the M sister fee rate of transactions not just by transactions in the singular So when you have a child that is super juicy it basically pays for the parent to get included at low as well So literally tell pace for parent got every parents dream to have their children pay for You said that when miners evaluate these Fee rates is that built in the Bitcoin core are they writing custom software for that Bitcoin core has a get black template corn which allows you to exactly do that just generate a black template But I believe that most miners are probably running custom code because for example They accept out of band payments to reprioritize transactions or they run their own wallet service on this side and always prioritize their own transactions or They might have some sort of other solver that optimizes block template building further So I think that I haven't looked at this in detail, but I think that at least they're not running default values because By default blocks created by Bitcoin core would leave a little space. I think about six kilo bytes and blocks are full if you look at them. So they must have at least treated a little bit and we're not when we say miners We're talking about pools. Yes, right so most miners as in the People running a six or whatever They just join our pool who does the coordination of the work and They basically the pool operator picks the block template that is being worked on and the miner just gets a separate workspace that they iterate over in order to try to fund the This problem sounds hard. Why is it hard to estimate periods? So block discovery is a random process think of like Decay of radio active isotopes What we do there is we can give you a half time It usually takes around this much of time for half of the atoms to Disappade But we can't tell you if we look at a single atom when it's actually gonna Disappade it might be immediately it might be at the half time it might take decades Right with blocks that's the same thing there in average coming in at I think about 9.7 minutes But when the next block is gonna be found is up to this random press on process Actually it is such that since there is no memory to the process It's every draw just has a chance to succeed at every point in time The next block is about 10 minutes away in the average. Yeah, it's really intuitive to think about that Right if even if you're 18 minutes into not finding a block the next block will be found in 10 minutes Yes, exactly you don't know when the next block is gonna be found So you don't know what transactions you will be competing against you might be competing against the transactions that I Translate in the man pool plus the transactions that get added in the next one minute You might be competing against the transactions in the man pool plus 10 minutes or plus 60 minutes Because about once a day There's a block that takes 60 minutes really you have this one shot to pick exactly the right view To slide in at the bottom of the block that you want to be in because if you don't slide in at the bottom of the block You're overpay and if you underestimate you're not gonna get confirmed in the time that you were aiming to be confident And so how do exchanges usually do this are they overpaying? Are they just estimating the the upper end? Maybe like who's paying those fees? Right, there's different scenarios some exchanges have different tiers like low-time preference and high-time preference or whatever and they treat those differently But generally most exchanges by now batch their withdrawals Which gives them a way to leverage their scale So if you're sending to 20 people every minute Making one transaction out of that is a lot cheaper than making 20 separate payments It's also much easier to manage your due-to-to-pull that way and And Then they just tend to very conservatively estimate their fees just Be in the next two blocks and maybe rather overpay slightly because it's so much less work To deal with all the customer compliance over step-transactions than to to pay like sure we're overpaying by 30% to be in the next block But it's not them that's overpaying Is they usually that gives passed on the customer? There's different models. I think in most actually the exchange pays But they take a flat fee for a withdraw or really yeah, so like it's time for a very long time for example I'd like I think a 90 cent 90 Euro cent flat restraw fee But then they'd bet every few minutes only you said that the member who hasn't really been empty for almost four months Yeah, that's correct. Is the ever gonna empty again as we go to the moon does the what happens to the man pool? Yeah, that's a great question. I think we'll eventually see a man pool empty again But there should probably be a long tail end to it emptying Because now in this for months a lot of the exchanges that usually would do consolidations to keep their you take so pool sized Manageable they haven't been able to get any of those through so when the fee rates go down now I think that we'll see more people put in their consolidation transactions had like three to five such as per bite And that I think we might not see an empty man pool for multiple months So even if the top fee rates get a lot more relaxed now Generally the competition to be in blocks seems to correlate with volatility and especially price rises when when the market Heats up and and people are more excited to trade There's more transaction volume on the network and Now we've seen in the past four weeks or so the price has been going more sideways There might have been even a small dips here and there and the top fee rates have come down On the on the weekends that's dropped first to seven set of sheet per bite then six and now last weekend Six was clear completely I don't think that getting a one set of super by transaction a true will be possible at any time soon But it'll be very possible to wait to the weekend to get a ten set of super by transactions Maybe from like a more met-of-you know the miners like this don't they like having high fees because One is revenue for them but also As we sort of zoom out we think about the decreasing block reward over time Don't we have to have a high fee environment in order for this this is the work under one hand You have to also consider that the exchange rate 10x in the last year So the same fee rates represent a 10x purchasing value in cost for Getting a sense to the same service a transaction into a block so while the fee rates are similar The cost of getting a transaction through has actually increased there miners do love it because I think he rates make about 17% or so of the block reward right now So I'm not sure yeah, that's that's a nice little tip right But there's definitely a concern that when we continue to reduce the blocks subsidy in the every four year having rewards schedule that eventually the system will have to subside just transaction fees and if the transaction fees are to low it will Basically not be Economic for miners to provide security to the bit-ten system so there's a good argument for not Increasing the block space To our degree where it's always gonna be empty if you want to do that you essentially have to Also switch to an endless block subsidy otherwise there is no economic incentive for miners to continue mining if there's Not enough fees unless unless your minimum fee rate at some point becomes So valuable that even at minimum fee rate any transactions are Some sort of sufficient revenue for miners to continue their business Maybe we can sort of circle back to what happens when transactions are elected from the mumpul and to talk about like what problems Like it introduced especially for fee bumping and and lightning channel closing right When a mumpul fills up as we said earlier the node will start dropping the lowest fee rate transactions And especially for people or services that use Unconfirmed inputs that can be a problem at times because you cannot Spend an input that is unknown to other nodes Right, so if all other nodes on a network have dropped a transaction Your polar option that spends the output from that drop transaction will not be able to relay on in that work So you Cannot only not spend your hands, but you can also not Repair or ties the prior transaction One thing that this solves basically is RBF because you can just rewrite a replaceable transaction and submit a transaction with a higher fee rate All right, so we went over CPSP can we go over our BS? Sure So dip one 25 introduces rules by which you are allowed to replace transactions You have to explicitly signal data transaction is replaceable and In that case before a transaction is confirmed the sender may issue an updated version of the transaction Which can completely change the outputs the only restriction is that it has to use one of the same inputs Otherwise it wouldn't be a replacement And wouldn't be so it has to be a conflicting transaction essentially and Additionally, it has to pay enough fees to replace the prior transaction and all the transactions that changed off of them In the mimpul so if you had like three transactions you have to pay more fees and the replacement than those three transactions together All right, so blast double spending It's over site. I do not like to term double spending in that context So the problem with that is a successful double spend means that Either you actually got two transactions that were in conflict confirmed Which could basically only happen if you have two competing blocks where one Block had a prior version and a second block had a netty and then the second block eventually becomes part of the best chain Or when you at least convince somebody that they had been paid But then actually managed to spend the funds somewhere else But here in this case are the f transactions are Explicitly labeling themselves as replaceable basically they're running around with a red lettered sign on front of their chest Do not trust me, right and most wallets are for just doesn't show your rb f transactions until they are confirmed Once confirmed in the blockchain they're exactly the same and same reliability as any other transaction But while tuing they are explicitly saying look, I could be replaced do not consider yourself paid So calling this a double spend is really just saying that well Somebody made extremely unreasonable assumptions about the reliability of a transaction that explicitly warned them that It's not reliable so I like conflicting transactions more in this context and maybe why do we need two ways to bump fees? Why do we need RBF and CPFB right so they have slightly different traders CPFP allows any recipient of a transaction to bump it Right that could be a recipient in the sense that the person that got paid or The sender if there was a change I'd put on the transaction it also doesn't change the tx ID because you're just training Advait transactions on it and it it takes more blocks this right because you now have to send a second transaction in order to Increase the effective fee rate of the first so more blocks this Easier to keep track off and more flexibility as in there's more parties than can interact with it RBF on the other hand allows you to completely replace the transaction Which means that it is more flexible But you potentially have to pay more fee use especially if somebody else changed off of your transaction already It changes the tx ID and a lot of wallets and services have been tracking payments by the tx ID Rather than looking at like what address got paid what the amount was or Whatever as in like treating the current addresses as in voices as they should be used they built a whole system around tx IDs so our BF transactions that They changed the inputs are outputs right otherwise they couldn't change the fees and that means that they have a new tx ID And it it is not trivial to keep proper track of that and to update your UX and UI to make that Easily accessible to your users right then also only the sender can run per transaction Think that because they have to reissue the updated variant of the transaction Given that it is a little more difficult to interact with our BF transactions a lot of services Only see them once they're confirmed once they're reliable so if you're trying to get a service To give you something very quickly You might want to choose to not do an RBS transaction the first place though that they can Reasonably assume oh this has a high enough fee read and we know the user We can trust them that they're sending us these three dollars actually and give them Existed it so I don't know what I thought it okay So we asked the question like what problems do does an employee eviction Cause for fee bumping and and also maybe the lightning Channel closing use case we talked a bit generically about how parent transactions being gone Staps you from being able to spend those unconfermed output But does this especially a problem in the context of lightning because when you close a lightning channel It's either the collaborative case where you have no problem because you can really go see it the closing transaction with your partner But where you really needed you're trying to unilatory close because your partner has Channel partner hasn't shown up in all then if you you have to fall back to the transaction that you had negotiated Sometime in the past when you last updated the commitment transaction So let's say that was in a low fee read time and now the fee read suffix loaded and you can't actually even Broadcast the commitment transaction to the network because it's too low fee read Now the problem is the parted that is closing the lightning channel under the LN penalty update mechanism their funds are actually locked with a csv So they can't do cp because The output is only spendable after the transaction is confirmed for multiple blocks So you can't obtain a transaction to a output that is not spendable while it's still in the income Especially for enlightening this introduces the volatility in the the block space martin introduces a headache because You can literally come into the situation where you can close your lightning channel due to the fee read So one approach I've heard about is to introduce anchor outputs Which are depending on the proposal either spendable by either side or spendable on certain conditions But they immediately spendable so they can be cp of peat or Another idea is to have package relay right because if the Channel closing transaction has a low fee read and you can then relay it together with a second transaction That'll work except if you're in the naturally closing because the csv issue still Pretends to that but either way if you get package relay you would be able to do away with the the estimate and Commitment transactions altogether because we talked about how fee estimation is hard for regular transactions The estimation for a commitment transactions is even much harder because you have no clue when you will want to use the transaction Yeah, that depends if they seem Very scary right you you have absolutely no clue what the fee rates will be like when when you actually try to use it So having Packetry lay would in combination with anchor outputs would allow you to always have a zero fee on the commitment transaction And then basically always bring your own fee when you broadcast it in the Cp P P Touch Transaction got it okay, so we sort of talked about specific but maybe we can zoom out and you know What are some ways that we could be using our box based more efficiently? What are some things that make us optimistic about the future? We still have Only about I think 40% or so Segwood inputs now about 50% percent of all transactions use Segwood inputs, but the majority of inputs is still non Segwood Once more people start using Segwood or even tap root once tap root comes out The input sizes will be smaller.

Go find out over at mimple.space slash enterprise. And now onto the show with Unant. Anant, welcome back to the show. Yes, you've earned. Thanks for coming in. So there's been a lot going on. I think the conversation around learning to self-custodies always an important wine. It's always one that's very fresh on my mind as well. And so we're seeing a lot of discussion. I think recently of course there was the news about Luke Dashia losing his coins. I think I don't know exactly how many but probably something in the range of 200 Bitcoin. So a series of anacorn. And so there's been a lot of people making some noise about this statement. Right? They've been saying, oh, look, even if a Bitcoin core developer couldn't secure his coins and what hope does the average person have? They've been saying this kind of narrative. Of course, I disagree with that strongly. So I wonder how are you think about that? See, self-custody, I would not like to claim that self-custody is, you know, the mentally the easiest things to do. It is a new way to secure your stuff. So it is going to be, there are mental hurdles where people are trying to do it. There are going to be new things that people have to learn. And it does not come without self-responsibility. So no matter how developers and builders want to make it easier, it doesn't come without learning and it doesn't come without self-responsibility. Having said that and having understood that this is journey even five years done in the last event, we'll be talking about self-custody. And why self-custody, what other things can make self-custody more secure like them, any word proposal or any new, odd court people are proposing. So there will always be improvements in self-custody. And the new one, you can see words that we use, that was not obvious there. So what I'm trying to say is that the self-custody is a journey. There is no perfect self-custody solution. And also self-custody solution is very personal. So in case of specifically the incident you're talking about, it is very specific and a very, very niche case. It's not going to, it's to, it doesn't really, it is more for foot. It doesn't really apply to normal users. No one is going to probably have like a custom security solution like he had. It's almost non-issue for regular horrors. But he has there is an aspect of if a start questioning okay, is there self-custody solution proper? Is it, you know, there is something more than they can do about it and you know the whole conversation starts again. And this is going to happen again and again. But as you will me know and what I've understood from that situation, most of it was honestly, it is more preferred because I don't know if there was even a core storage gailing work, the way we term core storage air gap storage. So there are moving parts and it is a developing story. We don't know how the details are. So once we know all the details are fit, probably there will be some learnings out of it. But we already know that you know you shouldn't roll your own self-custody solution to be being stuff that is very custom-pre- yourself and it is not really something with people who have used and tried and have to be not tried and tested. So these are the few things that you can already talk about that incident. So to the whole question around should people self-custody, what we end up having is a lot of conversation around what is the best way, right? We see people saying, oh just, you know, multi-signature is too complex. People say things like you should only do single signature with a pass phrase. That seems to be if I had to assess, let's say the meta on Bitcoin Twitter or online discussion, that seems to be the meta. They say, oh multi-sign, it is in the too hard basket for most people. Obviously, I disagree again. I think it is more like, you know, if you are a beginner, you should use maybe a guided solution, like have a professional help you. And intermediates and advanced level people you can learn. It is not that hard. I'm saying it. I'm curious how you see it, like single signature or multi-signature. See, we first of all, as you know, RSTs have been making the Bitcoin products for a while and we come from a single-signature word. Exhausted is a single-signature solution. It has all the aspects of typical-signature solution or what a wallet does. And we can come to the deconstruction of the wallet which will probably really help some of the listeners. But essentially, we come from that space. So definitely a very neat solution for people who are just getting started or people who have, you know, you know, small amount of money, obviously that is subjected. But essentially, you know, not like life savings or stuff . They will ship you some hardware devices if you need them and they will do a call with you and walk you through that process. An unchained have a really easy platform to use, which is perfect for you if you are a beginner and you just need some help to guide you through this process. They also have an inheritance checklist which comes as part of the concierge onboarding program so this can help you in terms of having things like a step-by-step checklist, letters for the executor or trustee and other things. Go to unchained.com slash concierge to get this. And finally, coincites.com, are my favorite producer of hardware signing devices. Most notably the cold card, but they have a range of products and gear that you will find really handy. With the cold card obviously it's one of the most popular Bitcoin hardware signing devices. You can use it in single signature or you can use it as part of a multi signature and it has all these features that really make it easy for you to do that. So you can register the multi signature forum. You can check the addresses on the device which gives you some more security. You can initialise the whole thing offline without even connecting to a computer. So there's so many features and it's such a reliable and versatile player that you can use as part of your Bitcoin security setup. Go to coincite.com, audio-cold cards and other gear there. Use code Lavera and you'll get a discount on your cold cards. Now back to the show. Yeah, I guess it's just an extra layer of verification, right? And certainly these are things that you do when you set up your multi-seagrant. And so I think this is a great way for people to give themselves that piece of mind as well because this is one of those things that's really kind of crazy but it's this idea that the keys can be ported are portable in a way that you can take the key like theoretically. I could have set up that same key in like a treasure but then imported into a cold card and it's going to sign the same way. It's going to sign the same coins in a way. So that's kind of useful and that's a step that people are doing to help verify. Okay, my access to my coins is, you know, or another one that people might do is do a test recovery, right? Like let me send you know $30 into this multi-seagrant and then just practice, oh I've lost one of the devices or I've lost this other thing, can I recover? You know, have I have I have the right pieces together to be able to recover? If something goes wrong and then this can give you that extra piece of mind. Okay, I was able to recover. Okay, I'm safe, right? That. And the best part is if you notice that every single user doesn't have to do this, if a lot of users have done it initially or you know some users do it regularly, then if any of these pieces, if any one of the coordinating software, any one of the hardware devices trying to do something funny, they'll be caught. So the incentive to actually try and steal funds when there are a lot of entities involved is actually reduced. So this is the very, very key part, see one of the things in Bitcoin we know is the securities also because of the numbers, right? Because there are so many private keys possible, it's not easy to guess them. It is not the same scale but the idea is if you have multiple entities, then you can minimize trust in any one of them. You don't need to test a-card endings of the user, no the one. I don't need to use a signing device, I can use another one, right? So as these things develop and we have like 12 or 13 signing devices available now of S5 or 6 coordinate or apps available now. So this becomes easier and easier and people will get more and more confident about it. There's a lot more talking about it, lot more education that includes about it, people who are listening to this podcast might come back with questions, they might feel slightly more comfortable. So things are converging with standard with the ecosystem and the education and I'm like you're like you're a server, I'm also a very bullish on policy. Yeah, yeah and so let's talk about spending now. So let's say I've set up my 203 and now I want to send some coins to you on our. So I say I'm asking me an address, I'm going to pay you you know 0.01 Bitcoin or whatever, what steps do I go through? Perfect. So if I give you an address and you have a two or three month as accept, the first thing to do is to check that address, I probably have you know I'm showing it showing it to you on a screen or I have you know message you that particular address. So when you when you put that address in your coordinating software and the coordinating software would probably take you know produce a B.S.B.T transaction, you would take it to your first hardware device. On that hardware device, the first thing is to make sure that you check whether that send to addresses character or not. That's the first step. The like I said, the change addresses automatically checked if that particular device is registered. Okay. So these are the two checks that happen during sending, if all the device are registered. So all you have to do because they're successfully registered. If you have chosen the right wallet from the from the signing device, then these are the these are the checks that happen. And I think maybe it's also so obviously in this case it's a two or three. So I'd have to go and let's say I have one device at home and then another device in a vault or some other location somewhere, I have to go to that other location and do a get the signature from that device or from that signing device to get the second signature, bring that back to you know the coordinating application. So in this case if it's cheaper or Spector or Sparrow or whatever and then once I've ingested that second PSBT signature, then it'll say, ah, this transaction is now valid and you can broadcast it, right? Absolutely. Yeah. I think you have to explain the user steps really well. So those are the checks that happen at one place, but then you take it to another location. The same kind of check you can do there. You can check there a saving address at your own office or any other location you have. Then you put it back to the coordinating software, not the coordinate software, because a specific transaction has been same and there's no way to further coordinating out because it doesn't have the private keys to change it. You can let the coordinating app, you know, broadcast the transaction. Right. And I think one other point just on practicality that might be useful for some people. I think I've been because I've been playing around with devices for years, right? So I think for me in practice I have found there are times where QR's can be difficult, right? So because the QR flow, like as an example, if your it depends on the device you're using, sometimes the resolution is bad or the the camera on the other devices bad. And so one tip that I've found useful is if you can have the QR scanning device, that could be maybe your home device. And then if you've got like one that's in a vault, as an example, and you might have a mix, right? You might have a mix in your core, and so then the devices in the vault maybe they can be a little bit easier to have a microSD for signing because they are a little, I think it depends on the flow, right? It depends on the coordinating app and everything, but if you just have a microSD card and you're just going into the vault area or into an office or somewhere, then maybe it's a little easier to kind of get the signature done because if you're kind of out in a remote location and you're trying to scan the QR and the signature is not working and things like this where it can be a bit difficult, right? So I think in that case it might be a little easier. Now of course there is NFC as well, so there's NFC devices, things like the the tap signer is an example, but I guess there is one downside with devices like the tap signer is you're getting less, yeah, because you can't check the addresses on this thing, you can't, there's less that you can check about the transaction. So, you know, there's tradeoffs with all of these things, it is a cheaper device, but I guess if you're storing serious, serious money, well then maybe you're going for the device, the bigger devices with a screen and with a keypad and things like this. So those are a few tips I guess that I would just offer for listeners as well, when you're thinking about if you're crafting your own multi-seg. Yeah, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the backups and the output descriptor and BSMS, can you decipher a little bit of this, at least, current state of play as we talk, you know, today's the 31st of January 2023, what's the current state of play with multi-seg and backups? See one thing, even I want to mention because it's a very important point, when you are keeping something in the shape, and you want to use as decar versus QR code, one of the things people forget is some of these devices used to not have a battery, right? So what you don't want to do is actually get that device back into your home and then do this stuff and then take it back, right? So if you have it in a safe, it is not about idea either that, you know, most of the new devices, that's where they have some kind of battery, the new ledgers, the G8, they have battery, or if you have like cold card, that requires a battery, this is not a battery, you just carry the battery with you. So carry the battery and as you can see, you can see, you can see, you know, just do the piece there, either through QR code or SD card and then come back, do not carry the sign, you don't have to carry the sign and do it back, you can keep it back to you. Right, yes, so just to explain there, so the idea here is let's say we've got a two or three multi-seag and just doing like a big amount of coin on this or whatever, the whole point is to not have to have like, okay, yes, at the start, when you set up that core, yes, all three devices can be in the same location because you haven't put any coins on there, but once you put coins on, then you don't want to bring them back together because theoretically you're vulnerable at that point, right? Like if a criminal or a someone comes to, you know, try to attack you at that point, you're vulnerable. Yes, even at creation actually because the way P is between multi-seagors is not really interactive that is, you can actually not have them at the same location, they need one of them. Right, yeah, of course, yeah, so you can do one important, you know, so it's one important, you know, one of the other, yeah, I mean, I was just saying more from a practicality because you might want to let's say you want to set it up and then test recovery, test with small amounts, before you separate the devices and put them into, you know, different locations, one in the mountain, one in the, you know, one in the vault, one in the office, one in the, you know, somewhere, so I think that's probably where I was saying that just from a practicality point of you, but then once they, once you put the coins on there, like serious coin on there, then you don't want to pull them together because now, you know, that's where the risk is. So anyway, we're spoken about that. Let's get back to the backup question. So, you know, typically this means you save a PDR for an output descriptor or BSMS, he tells what's the current state of play there. Yeah. So, so why do we need these, these output descriptors or work competitions because even if you have two of the three keys, you cannot recover your phone, right? I just want to repeat that in a multi-sick, if you let's say in a three or five multi-sick, it doesn't mean that if you have three of the five keys, you can completely, you can not completely, you cannot even recover any of your funds. The reason being is that, okay, you have the three keys to the safe, let's imagine another safe, right? So, you have three keys of the safe and you can open the safe, but how do you find that safe, right? How do you get to that safe? That is the map, you know, in that terms, is what the word configuration is and that word configuration or the multi-sick configuration finds contains the map details that it's basically contained, the other public details of the key that you would need to unlock your funds basically or get access to your funds. Just just to want to be clear why multi-sick configuration finds are so important. Now, that is where things like output descriptors and you know, BSMS and all these things come through. So, output descriptor is it's a very neat standard, it takes care of all the different aspects of what a configuration means. Configuration doesn't just mean the expo, also means the path and the script type that you're using and start writing them, right? So, that is what forms output descriptor in a simple sense, I'm not getting into time login multi-sick yet, but that's an output descriptor. And if you have the output descriptor and if you have the minimum number of keys, you can definitely access the funds. If you have three keys of the file, and you have the multi-sick configuration file or output descriptor, you do not need the other two keys. That's the importance of it. I'll put descriptor as a format, which a lot of wallets use. Now, there are like as a there are multiple pieces in there, like the expo of the path, the you know master fingerprint, the script type. So, these are the part of output descriptor. I would say an improvement to that is the BSMS, which is bit coin, secure, multi-sick setup, I think, but BSMS essentially has the output descriptors given a specific output descriptor template, but it also has some other details. One very neat detail that BSMS has is actually it has the first address of the multi-sick, right? I really like this part and why that is important. So, let's imagine you have these five devices. One of the option after registration is you go away and check all these five devices for all the expobs, all the paths and all the derivations in this and that. There's one we are going it. But, alternatively what you could do is you could, if it's a normal multi-sick, you can just check the first address, right? Because the first address is a derivation of all these components. So, if the first address is correct, or is it it's matching across the five devices, then there is no way they could have changed one of the expobs, or they could have changed one of the paths because they will not get the first receiving address. So, by checking one piece, you have to check, you have actually checked multiple of these, multiple of these items, right? As you were mentioning, the BSMS has the first address and so you were saying that basically because the first address has to be the same, then it's I guess you're saying that's the reason why you find it useful as a wallet developer when you're coding or making and building this, right? Even from a user point of view, instead of checking for like five different things, you have to check all the cosine and expobs, so you have to check five expobs, plus they'll have to check the five derivation paths, plus they will have to check the five you know script types, because any of this going wrong, where you mean that it's a completely different world. So, if instead of that what you could do, in a simple case, there are complex case where there doesn't apply, but in a simple case what that means is if you would check the first address, you essentially have to check all the input parameters to the first address. So, if I check this one address across the five device, I know it is the right registration. So, these are the kind of you know improvement that are happening from a standard point of view, and that is why I said the general standards are leading the world's better UX in the multi-six space. I say, yeah, okay, and so let's talk a little bit about capabilities specifically, let's talk a little bit about some of the, sorry, one other thing. So, with this whole output descriptor BSMS, I guess the important point just for people to remember is that you can keep multiple backups of this. Now, yes, it impacts your privacy, but it helps your redundancy and your ability to recover something goes wrong. So, this piece, this output descriptor, the BSMS, the wallet configuration file, whatever it's called, make sure you have multiple backups of that. You might even think about having a copy of that with your lawyer or someone who you're doing inheritance planning with because it'll be a central as part of the recovery process there. So, that's just something to keep in mind. One more thing you could prove in those files is which is very practicalist. If you have the same devices, let's say in a safe, you can keep a copy there. If you have like three devices in three safe, in three different locations, this keep one copy with each of them. So, even if you carry USB, one I mean, yeah, or you can just like have it in an PDF or something. So, that seeds that's nothing for you right like so it's it's important to think about the perspective yeah sorry I'm just on that point we did some you know back of them look at vision but like I said a typical multi-sick today cost five hundred right and let's say even if you have bit coins worth five thousand dollars which is probably you know a quarter of a bit coin a point to bit coin depending on the price that that will mean you know something around five to ten percent of the security cost nine in bitcoin you know that it can ten eggs very easily and if it does ten eggs then it will become like one percent of your one percent of your cost having a security cost of one percent to secure the whole amount is a decent security cost right so if you think about it in those terms and have you know put in some hours of effort actually like you know you have orders of magnitude better security and the cost is not really I it is one percent of the potential so that's that's probably one way to think about it yeah yeah okay so I think that's the multi-seag aspect let's talk a little bit about bitcoin for India so I unfortunately could make it last year because of clashes and stuff but I'm looking forward to being there off the top my head is October 14th of 15th I think yeah do you want to just give us an update on bitcoin for India? Absolutely so this is this is the community piece that some of us are involved in with other volunteers but more than happy to you know put it on this platform as well that you know stiffened a little bit person there and there will be many other bitcoiners who would be there who would be you know talking to blacks in India and talking multi-seag talking pastries talking a lot of stuff you know how to do how to do probably running a node so it will be a mixed conference like like it was the standard technical track and there will be a main track but we are we are very excited about it and we are obviously going to look for more and more participation this time from speakers and from audience so this is an October 14th of 10th of the data as a song. Fantastic and in Bangalore right and so I'm also you know it's been one year now like bitcoin it will it will it will have been you've already had the first conference you've been growing this meet-up network let's say of more committed bitcoiners and so hopefully there'll be a you know a growth in the community by then and who knows maybe there will be a lot of people joining the community between now and then so maybe they'll all be there as well so looking forward to that and yeah any any other points you wanted to mention before we finish off. No I think I think by the time this probably the the part goes out the keeper Apple would be available on mainnet till now it was on testnet it is still beta but it is available mainnet so it's very easy for people to test out so do give it a run try it out with small amounts of amounts of sats and give us some feedback it is an awesome product and we hope you love it. Fantastic okay and thanks for joining me. Thanks you for joining me. Cheers. I hope you found that discussion helpful and make sure to share this episode with any family of friends who are curious about setting up multi-signature and bitcoin security it's been a while since we've really walked through some of the details of this of course I have those earlier episodes with a range of people talking about these things I will include those in the show notes also but I think this one is a good overview episode for people who want to understand where things are at today with multi-signature so share the episode and the show notes are available at StefanLevera.com slash four five five thanks for listening and I'll see you in the sitters"}	{"title":"SLP455 Anant Tapadia - Single Sig or Multi Sig?","transcript_by":"masterchief164 via TBTBTC v1.0.0\\n","categories":"['podcast']","tags":"['multisig']","speakers":"['Stephan Livera', 'Anant Tapadia']","date":"2023-02-01","media":"https://anchor.fm/s/7d083a4/podcast/play/64348045/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2023-1-1%2Ff7fafb12-9441-7d85-d557-e9e5d18ab788.mp3","body":" Hi, you're listening to Stefan Le Verapodcast, a show about Bitcoin and Austrian economic expertise by Swan Bitcoin.

I think the conversation around learning to self-custodies always an important wine. It's always one that's very fresh on my mind as well. And so we're seeing a lot of discussion. I think recently of course there was the news about Luke Dashia losing his coins. I think I don't know exactly how many but probably something in the range of 200 Bitcoin. So a series of anacorn. And so there's been a lot of people making some noise about this statement. Right? They've been saying, oh, look, even if a Bitcoin core developer couldn't secure his coins and what hope does the average person have? They've been saying this kind of narrative. Of course, I disagree with that strongly. So I wonder how are you think about that? See, self-custody, I would not like to claim that self-custody is, you know, the mentally the easiest things to do. It is a new way to secure your stuff. So it is going to be, there are mental hurdles where people are trying to do it. There are going to be new things that people have to learn. And it does not come without self-responsibility. So no matter how developers and builders want to make it easier, it doesn't come without learning and it doesn't come without self-responsibility. Having said that and having understood that this is journey even five years done in the last event, we'll be talking about self-custody. And why self-custody, what other things can make self-custody more secure like them, any word proposal or any new, odd court people are proposing. So there will always be improvements in self-custody. And the new one, you can see words that we use, that was not obvious there. So what I'm trying to say is that the self-custody is a journey. There is no perfect self-custody solution. And also self-custody solution is very personal. So in case of specifically the incident you're talking about, it is very specific and a very, very niche case. It's not going to, it's to, it doesn't really, it is more for foot. It doesn't really apply to normal users. No one is going to probably have like a custom security solution like he had. It's almost non-issue for regular horrors. But he has there is an aspect of if a start questioning okay, is there self-custody solution proper? Is it, you know, there is something more than they can do about it and you know the whole conversation starts again. And this is going to happen again and again. But as you will me know and what I've understood from that situation, most of it was honestly, it is more preferred because I don't know if there was even a core storage gailing work, the way we term core storage air gap storage. So there are moving parts and it is a developing story. We don't know how the details are. So once we know all the details are fit, probably there will be some learnings out of it. But we already know that you know you shouldn't roll your own self-custody solution to be being stuff that is very custom-pre- yourself and it is not really something with people who have used and tried and have to be not tried and tested. So these are the few things that you can already talk about that incident. So to the whole question around should people self-custody, what we end up having is a lot of conversation around what is the best way, right? We see people saying, oh just, you know, multi-signature is too complex. People say things like you should only do single signature with a pass phrase. That seems to be if I had to assess, let's say the meta on Bitcoin Twitter or online discussion, that seems to be the meta. They say, oh multi-sign, it is in the too hard basket for most people. Obviously, I disagree again. I think it is more like, you know, if you are a beginner, you should use maybe a guided solution, like have a professional help you. And intermediates and advanced level people you can learn. It is not that hard. I'm saying it. I'm curious how you see it, like single signature or multi-signature. See, we first of all, as you know, RSTs have been making the Bitcoin products for a while and we come from a single-signature word. Exhausted is a single-signature solution. It has all the aspects of typical-signature solution or what a wallet does. And we can come to the deconstruction of the wallet which will probably really help some of the listeners. But essentially, we come from that space. So definitely a very neat solution for people who are just getting started or people who have, you know, you know, small amount of money, obviously that is subjected. But essentially, you know, not like life savings or stuff . They will ship you some hardware devices if you need them and they will do a call with you and walk you through that process. An unchained have a really easy platform to use, which is perfect for you if you are a beginner and you just need some help to guide you through this process. They also have an inheritance checklist which comes as part of the concierge onboarding program so this can help you in terms of having things like a step-by-step checklist, letters for the executor or trustee and other things. Go to unchained.com slash concierge to get this. And finally, coincites.com, are my favorite producer of hardware signing devices. Most notably the cold card, but they have a range of products and gear that you will find really handy. With the cold card obviously it's one of the most popular Bitcoin hardware signing devices. You can use it in single signature or you can use it as part of a multi signature and it has all these features that really make it easy for you to do that. So you can register the multi signature forum. You can check the addresses on the device which gives you some more security. You can initialise the whole thing offline without even connecting to a computer. So there's so many features and it's such a reliable and versatile player that you can use as part of your Bitcoin security setup. Go to coincite.com, audio-cold cards and other gear there. Use code Lavera and you'll get a discount on your cold cards. Now back to the show. Yeah, I guess it's just an extra layer of verification, right? And certainly these are things that you do when you set up your multi-seagrant. And so I think this is a great way for people to give themselves that piece of mind as well because this is one of those things that's really kind of crazy but it's this idea that the keys can be ported are portable in a way that you can take the key like theoretically. I could have set up that same key in like a treasure but then imported into a cold card and it's going to sign the same way. It's going to sign the same coins in a way. So that's kind of useful and that's a step that people are doing to help verify. Okay, my access to my coins is, you know, or another one that people might do is do a test recovery, right? Like let me send you know $30 into this multi-seagrant and then just practice, oh I've lost one of the devices or I've lost this other thing, can I recover? You know, have I have I have the right pieces together to be able to recover? If something goes wrong and then this can give you that extra piece of mind. Okay, I was able to recover. Okay, I'm safe, right? That. And the best part is if you notice that every single user doesn't have to do this, if a lot of users have done it initially or you know some users do it regularly, then if any of these pieces, if any one of the coordinating software, any one of the hardware devices trying to do something funny, they'll be caught. So the incentive to actually try and steal funds when there are a lot of entities involved is actually reduced. So this is the very, very key part, see one of the things in Bitcoin we know is the securities also because of the numbers, right? Because there are so many private keys possible, it's not easy to guess them. It is not the same scale but the idea is if you have multiple entities, then you can minimize trust in any one of them. You don't need to test a-card endings of the user, no the one. I don't need to use a signing device, I can use another one, right? So as these things develop and we have like 12 or 13 signing devices available now of S5 or 6 coordinate or apps available now. So this becomes easier and easier and people will get more and more confident about it. There's a lot more talking about it, lot more education that includes about it, people who are listening to this podcast might come back with questions, they might feel slightly more comfortable. So things are converging with standard with the ecosystem and the education and I'm like you're like you're a server, I'm also a very bullish on policy. Yeah, yeah and so let's talk about spending now. So let's say I've set up my 203 and now I want to send some coins to you on our. So I say I'm asking me an address, I'm going to pay you you know 0.01 Bitcoin or whatever, what steps do I go through? Perfect. So if I give you an address and you have a two or three month as accept, the first thing to do is to check that address, I probably have you know I'm showing it showing it to you on a screen or I have you know message you that particular address. So when you when you put that address in your coordinating software and the coordinating software would probably take you know produce a B.S.B.T transaction, you would take it to your first hardware device. On that hardware device, the first thing is to make sure that you check whether that send to addresses character or not. That's the first step. The like I said, the change addresses automatically checked if that particular device is registered. Okay. So these are the two checks that happen during sending, if all the device are registered. So all you have to do because they're successfully registered. If you have chosen the right wallet from the from the signing device, then these are the these are the checks that happen. And I think maybe it's also so obviously in this case it's a two or three. So I'd have to go and let's say I have one device at home and then another device in a vault or some other location somewhere, I have to go to that other location and do a get the signature from that device or from that signing device to get the second signature, bring that back to you know the coordinating application. So in this case if it's cheaper or Spector or Sparrow or whatever and then once I've ingested that second PSBT signature, then it'll say, ah, this transaction is now valid and you can broadcast it, right? Absolutely. Yeah. I think you have to explain the user steps really well. So those are the checks that happen at one place, but then you take it to another location. The same kind of check you can do there. You can check there a saving address at your own office or any other location you have. Then you put it back to the coordinating software, not the coordinate software, because a specific transaction has been same and there's no way to further coordinating out because it doesn't have the private keys to change it. You can let the coordinating app, you know, broadcast the transaction. Right. And I think one other point just on practicality that might be useful for some people. I think I've been because I've been playing around with devices for years, right? So I think for me in practice I have found there are times where QR's can be difficult, right? So because the QR flow, like as an example, if your it depends on the device you're using, sometimes the resolution is bad or the the camera on the other devices bad. And so one tip that I've found useful is if you can have the QR scanning device, that could be maybe your home device. And then if you've got like one that's in a vault, as an example, and you might have a mix, right? You might have a mix in your core, and so then the devices in the vault maybe they can be a little bit easier to have a microSD for signing because they are a little, I think it depends on the flow, right? It depends on the coordinating app and everything, but if you just have a microSD card and you're just going into the vault area or into an office or somewhere, then maybe it's a little easier to kind of get the signature done because if you're kind of out in a remote location and you're trying to scan the QR and the signature is not working and things like this where it can be a bit difficult, right? So I think in that case it might be a little easier. Now of course there is NFC as well, so there's NFC devices, things like the the tap signer is an example, but I guess there is one downside with devices like the tap signer is you're getting less, yeah, because you can't check the addresses on this thing, you can't, there's less that you can check about the transaction. So, you know, there's tradeoffs with all of these things, it is a cheaper device, but I guess if you're storing serious, serious money, well then maybe you're going for the device, the bigger devices with a screen and with a keypad and things like this. So those are a few tips I guess that I would just offer for listeners as well, when you're thinking about if you're crafting your own multi-seg. Yeah, okay, so let's talk a little bit about the backups and the output descriptor and BSMS, can you decipher a little bit of this, at least, current state of play as we talk, you know, today's the 31st of January 2023, what's the current state of play with multi-seg and backups? See one thing, even I want to mention because it's a very important point, when you are keeping something in the shape, and you want to use as decar versus QR code, one of the things people forget is some of these devices used to not have a battery, right? So what you don't want to do is actually get that device back into your home and then do this stuff and then take it back, right? So if you have it in a safe, it is not about idea either that, you know, most of the new devices, that's where they have some kind of battery, the new ledgers, the G8, they have battery, or if you have like cold card, that requires a battery, this is not a battery, you just carry the battery with you. So carry the battery and as you can see, you can see, you can see, you know, just do the piece there, either through QR code or SD card and then come back, do not carry the sign, you don't have to carry the sign and do it back, you can keep it back to you. Right, yes, so just to explain there, so the idea here is let's say we've got a two or three multi-seag and just doing like a big amount of coin on this or whatever, the whole point is to not have to have like, okay, yes, at the start, when you set up that core, yes, all three devices can be in the same location because you haven't put any coins on there, but once you put coins on, then you don't want to bring them back together because theoretically you're vulnerable at that point, right? Like if a criminal or a someone comes to, you know, try to attack you at that point, you're vulnerable. Yes, even at creation actually because the way P is between multi-seagors is not really interactive that is, you can actually not have them at the same location, they need one of them. Right, yeah, of course, yeah, so you can do one important, you know, so it's one important, you know, one of the other, yeah, I mean, I was just saying more from a practicality because you might want to let's say you want to set it up and then test recovery, test with small amounts, before you separate the devices and put them into, you know, different locations, one in the mountain, one in the, you know, one in the vault, one in the office, one in the, you know, somewhere, so I think that's probably where I was saying that just from a practicality point of you, but then once they, once you put the coins on there, like serious coin on there, then you don't want to pull them together because now, you know, that's where the risk is. So anyway, we're spoken about that. Let's get back to the backup question. So, you know, typically this means you save a PDR for an output descriptor or BSMS, he tells what's the current state of play there. Yeah. So, so why do we need these, these output descriptors or work competitions because even if you have two of the three keys, you cannot recover your phone, right? I just want to repeat that in a multi-sick, if you let's say in a three or five multi-sick, it doesn't mean that if you have three of the five keys, you can completely, you can not completely, you cannot even recover any of your funds. The reason being is that, okay, you have the three keys to the safe, let's imagine another safe, right? So, you have three keys of the safe and you can open the safe, but how do you find that safe, right? How do you get to that safe? That is the map, you know, in that terms, is what the word configuration is and that word configuration or the multi-sick configuration finds contains the map details that it's basically contained, the other public details of the key that you would need to unlock your funds basically or get access to your funds. Just just to want to be clear why multi-sick configuration finds are so important. Now, that is where things like output descriptors and you know, BSMS and all these things come through. So, output descriptor is it's a very neat standard, it takes care of all the different aspects of what a configuration means. Configuration doesn't just mean the expo, also means the path and the script type that you're using and start writing them, right? So, that is what forms output descriptor in a simple sense, I'm not getting into time login multi-sick yet, but that's an output descriptor. And if you have the output descriptor and if you have the minimum number of keys, you can definitely access the funds. If you have three keys of the file, and you have the multi-sick configuration file or output descriptor, you do not need the other two keys. That's the importance of it. I'll put descriptor as a format, which a lot of wallets use. Now, there are like as a there are multiple pieces in there, like the expo of the path, the you know master fingerprint, the script type. So, these are the part of output descriptor. I would say an improvement to that is the BSMS, which is bit coin, secure, multi-sick setup, I think, but BSMS essentially has the output descriptors given a specific output descriptor template, but it also has some other details. One very neat detail that BSMS has is actually it has the first address of the multi-sick, right? I really like this part and why that is important. So, let's imagine you have these five devices. One of the option after registration is you go away and check all these five devices for all the expobs, all the paths and all the derivations in this and that. There's one we are going it. But, alternatively what you could do is you could, if it's a normal multi-sick, you can just check the first address, right? Because the first address is a derivation of all these components. So, if the first address is correct, or is it it's matching across the five devices, then there is no way they could have changed one of the expobs, or they could have changed one of the paths because they will not get the first receiving address. So, by checking one piece, you have to check, you have actually checked multiple of these, multiple of these items, right? As you were mentioning, the BSMS has the first address and so you were saying that basically because the first address has to be the same, then it's I guess you're saying that's the reason why you find it useful as a wallet developer when you're coding or making and building this, right? Even from a user point of view, instead of checking for like five different things, you have to check all the cosine and expobs, so you have to check five expobs, plus they'll have to check the five derivation paths, plus they will have to check the five you know script types, because any of this going wrong, where you mean that it's a completely different world. So, if instead of that what you could do, in a simple case, there are complex case where there doesn't apply, but in a simple case what that means is if you would check the first address, you essentially have to check all the input parameters to the first address. So, if I check this one address across the five device, I know it is the right registration. So, these are the kind of you know improvement that are happening from a standard point of view, and that is why I said the general standards are leading the world's better UX in the multi-six space. I say, yeah, okay, and so let's talk a little bit about capabilities specifically, let's talk a little bit about some of the, sorry, one other thing. So, with this whole output descriptor BSMS, I guess the important point just for people to remember is that you can keep multiple backups of this. Now, yes, it impacts your privacy, but it helps your redundancy and your ability to recover something goes wrong. So, this piece, this output descriptor, the BSMS, the wallet configuration file, whatever it's called, make sure you have multiple backups of that. You might even think about having a copy of that with your lawyer or someone who you're doing inheritance planning with because it'll be a central as part of the recovery process there. So, that's just something to keep in mind. One more thing you could prove in those files is which is very practicalist. If you have the same devices, let's say in a safe, you can keep a copy there. If you have like three devices in three safe, in three different locations, this keep one copy with each of them. So, even if you carry USB, one I mean, yeah, or you can just like have it in an PDF or something. So, that seeds that's nothing for you right like so it's it's important to think about the perspective yeah sorry I'm just on that point we did some you know back of them look at vision but like I said a typical multi-sick today cost five hundred right and let's say even if you have bit coins worth five thousand dollars which is probably you know a quarter of a bit coin a point to bit coin depending on the price that that will mean you know something around five to ten percent of the security cost nine in bitcoin you know that it can ten eggs very easily and if it does ten eggs then it will become like one percent of your one percent of your cost having a security cost of one percent to secure the whole amount is a decent security cost right so if you think about it in those terms and have you know put in some hours of effort actually like you know you have orders of magnitude better security and the cost is not really I it is one percent of the potential so that's that's probably one way to think about it yeah yeah okay so I think that's the multi-seag aspect let's talk a little bit about bitcoin for India so I unfortunately could make it last year because of clashes and stuff but I'm looking forward to being there off the top my head is October 14th of 15th I think yeah do you want to just give us an update on bitcoin for India? Absolutely so this is this is the community piece that some of us are involved in with other volunteers but more than happy to you know put it on this platform as well that you know stiffened a little bit person there and there will be many other bitcoiners who would be there who would be you know talking to blacks in India and talking multi-seag talking pastries talking a lot of stuff you know how to do how to do probably running a node so it will be a mixed conference like like it was the standard technical track and there will be a main track but we are we are very excited about it and we are obviously going to look for more and more participation this time from speakers and from audience so this is an October 14th of 10th of the data as a song. Fantastic and in Bangalore right and so I'm also you know it's been one year now like bitcoin it will it will it will have been you've already had the first conference you've been growing this meet-up network let's say of more committed bitcoiners and so hopefully there'll be a you know a growth in the community by then and who knows maybe there will be a lot of people joining the community between now and then so maybe they'll all be there as well so looking forward to that and yeah any any other points you wanted to mention before we finish off. No I think I think by the time this probably the the part goes out the keeper Apple would be available on mainnet till now it was on testnet it is still beta but it is available mainnet so it's very easy for people to test out so do give it a run try it out with small amounts of amounts of sats and give us some feedback it is an awesome product and we hope you love it. Fantastic okay and thanks for joining me. Thanks you for joining me. Cheers. I hope you found that discussion helpful and make sure to share this episode with any family of friends who are curious about setting up multi-signature and bitcoin security it's been a while since we've really walked through some of the details of this of course I have those earlier episodes with a range of people talking about these things I will include those in the show notes also but I think this one is a good overview episode for people who want to understand where things are at today with multi-signature so share the episode and the show notes are available at StefanLevera.com slash four five five thanks for listening and I'll see you in the sitters"}	lTBXBbgzp7VzuPxP3jQOQR/bpYzK9i2LWXAwRGntZbk=	queued	\N	2023-03-27 16:04:07.109+03	2023-03-27 16:04:07.109+03	\N

This is a simulation.\\n\\n##  Google layoffs, ChatGPT fears\\n\\n Google seems to have a monster under its bed named ChatGPT. The recent launch of the popular AI chatbot has set off alarms at Google, causing the company to call in its dads for help. Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google and controlling shareholders of the parent company Alphabet, have come back to the company after having left their daily roles back in 2019, also known as the Before Times. To do whatever men under 50 with unlimited money can do, which is literally anything. The pair were invited by current CEO Sundar Pichai last month to offer advice and pitch ideas. Google plans to launch over 20 AI products by the end of the year, including a demo version of its search engine with Chatbot features. This is very exciting news for the company's AI division and everyone but the 12,000 people in other departments who are being laid off by Google do allegedly to economic downturn. The company is also facing several antitrust lawsuits, which is the opposite of trust from Epic and Match LLC, as well as the US departments of Justice. Just one department, the Justice one. All this pressure could end up hurting Google bad, especially if Bing can implement Chatbot features first and someone notices. DuckDuckGo has when it just says, turn off your computer. Have you noticed Bing is different? What?\\n\\n##  Twitter bans third-party clients\\n\\n Twitter has officially banned third party clients, but why should we care about third? Bronze is a subpar medal that went out of style 3,000 years ago and yet, well that is completely true Twitter may have not been super upfront about how or why they were doing this. The official Twitter dev account said that the platform was enforcing its long-standing API rules and then neglected to, you know, name a rule. Then, yesterday, and Gadget noticed that Twitter had added a clause to the developer agreement that banned the ability to use or access the licensed materials to create or attempt to create a substitute or similar service or product to the Twitter applications. The company that made Twitterific, the third party client that actually coined the term tweet, released a blog post saying that the social platform has become a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy or worth coming up with fun colloquialisms for. That's not part of the quota. In a fun coincidence, that same Twitter, now owned by Elon Musk, also known as Buffalo Bill Dodger, is being sued for refusing to pay the consulting firm that assisted in the lawsuit the company launched against Musk when he tried to back it up buying it. That is amazing. I tried coming up with a analogy for this situation, but it's just too wacky. The situation is the joke itself.\\n\\n##  MSI motherboards Secure Boot issue\\n\\n And the secure boot feature on at least 300 MSI motherboards is not working as intended, depending on who's doing the intending. For the uninitiated, I almost said unintended. Secure boot is a feature in motherboard firmware that ensures PCs only boot software that is trusted by the motherboard manufacturer. However, security researcher David Putaki discovered hundreds of MSI motherboards would let just any old software boot. The motherboards have no standard of these days, but don't worry, MSI has responded to the findings, and according to them, it's working flawlessly. The manufacturer said they added a second setting called image execution policy that is set to always execute software by default, even though secure boot is enabled. They said the default always execute setting is to offer a user-friendly environment, which makes perfect sense, think of how user-friendly it would be to not have a front door. You can just walk right into your house and not have to lock anything when you leave, and when you're really mad, no one knows. And your counter is a super clean because everyone stole your stuff. You've got nothing to apologize for. According to WCCF Tech, this behavior may not be isolated to MSI. They claim that ASUS and Gigabyte boards may also have issues with securing their boot. I guess no one knows how to tie their shoes anymore. Mine as well will be slip-ons that never made it in frame, but I almost hit the camera. I'm taller on one side. Oh. I just fell all around when nerds try to throw. No, no, no, no, no, no. No.\\n\\n##  Hetzner\\n\\n What's time for QuickBits brought to you by Hetsner, the leading hosting provider and data center operator in Europe with hundreds of thousands of servers in operation. They don't serve beer, but they do serve reliability, which is much safer for computers. By combining its strengths in innovative technology, attractive prices, experts support, and flexible customer service, Hetsner extended its market both within and outside Europe. They have two high tech data centers in Germany, in Nuremberg and Falcon Stein, and one in Helsinki, Finland. And if you're thinking to yourself, hey, I'm on the east slash west coast of the United States. Why should I care about some European servers? Hetsner is now covering both of those coasts with their latest location in Hillsborough, Oregon.

In a press release, the company stated the breach was shut down within 24 hours of being detected. What they didn't mention there, but they did mention in an SEC filing was that the data of 37 million customers was hacked and that the breach wasn't detected for over a month. But once they detected it. Now you have reason to switch to AT&T that does involve an unhealthy obsession with the women from their ads. Leave Lily alone, guys. It's worth getting a VPN again.\\n\\n##  KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut ransomware attack\\n\\n Canada for. Speaking of SEC filings, young brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, and other toilet runners, admitted they also had data stolen. They suffered an attack from a ransomware gang so bad over 300 locations in the UK were forced to shut down. Thankfully, all locations are back up and running, so you can panic eat, fried chicken as you wait for something to hack you. It's their food, it's like popping up balloon in the toilet so bad. Really that hackers were doing this in favor, they're doing this in favor, they're doing this in favor.\\n\\n##  RX 6000 GPUs killed by washing?\\n\\n Chris Fix, a German repair service that was sent 48 radion RX 6000 cards with crack GPUs in a matter of weeks, thinks they may have figured out just what happened. After determining, most of the cards were bought second hand, the repair shop posted a video explaining that they believe the cards were sold by crypto miners and somehow water got trapped under the chip and that expanded when the card got hot. Chris Fix thinks they were stored in a human environment, while Reddit thinks they were hosed down by miners before sale like in that viral clip. Some Vietnamese miners have cleaned up their old graphics cards after Ethereum merged by bathing them with extremely high risk. You gotta ask yourself what's more important, a clean card or a card that doesn't explode. That's a tough one. It's like free farmers. Gotta keep them clean. Sposions though. Check on the menu baby.\\n\\n##  Cablemod 12VHPWR cable melts\\n\\n Melting 49 is our back in the news because cable mods 12 volt high power cable has now gotten a little extra Kishby. Reddit user Humblebrilliant654 posted pictures of the cable on the site and thankfully cable mod has promised to replace the product. Humble swore that he inserted the cable into the GPU properly and that he had been using it for two months or you know someone's lying on Reddit but that's that's crazy. They would get down voted. As a 16 year old girl I can tell you Reddit's honest. 16 at six\\n\\n##  Wizards of the Coast apologizes\\n\\n and Wizards of the Coast have finally apologized for trying to release a new worst version of the current open gaming license which allows creators to make and publish content for the Dungeons & Dragons RPG. Just after Pathfinder publisher Peizo announced 1,500 companies have pledged their support for the OGL alternative, the open RPG creative license or ORC, or we're calling it the ORC, Wizards of the Coast said that they would no longer de-authorize the earlier version of the open gaming license except that they still are, just not for content already published under the earlier version. I guess that's a half lie, which is only half as bad as their last statement, so at least they're improving. Half-elf, half-orc, half-lings? Half-ling, they love half. Demigod, demigod, demigmore. And our tech news coverage is improving every episode, so make sure you come back on Monday, there may be kittens, or kittens, just korkins, durable, brutish kittens.
